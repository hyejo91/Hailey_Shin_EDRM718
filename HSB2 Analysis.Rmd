```{r, include = FALSE}

## Relationshi of SES to Math Scores

This section will look at the relationship of socioeconimic status to math scores. I will begin with the summary of the math scores.

```{r}
HSB2 %>%
  group_by(ses) %>%
  summarize(mean(math), median(math), sd(math), min(math), max(math))
```



Now let;s look at a plot.
```{r}
HSB2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(ses, math)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
